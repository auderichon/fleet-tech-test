### Introduction

I am happy to present this frontend tech test to apply to an internship position @ Fleet.
The goal of this project was to create a simple movie browsing app in React.

It is a React App bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It also uses the [MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API from IMDb.

### Installation

If you would like to see the app in your browser:
```bash
# in your terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/auderichon/fleet-tech-test.git
$ cd fleet-tech-test
```

### Setup

```bash
# install npm packages
$ npm install
```

### Run the app in dev mode

```bash
$ npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
